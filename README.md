# Django-Travel-Manager
This is a Django website for managing visited places and dream destinations. 
Each user can share a post - a picture (URL) of a cool destination so other users can get a new idea for their next travel.
Ofcourse, each user can interract with the posts of others.

It is my final project at SoftUni so you can find most of the code in the folder "FinalProject".


Check out some screenshots:
